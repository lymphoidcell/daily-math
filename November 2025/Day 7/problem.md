# Daily Math Problem - DAY 7

### Problem Metadata
- **Date**: 2025-11-17
- **Problem Number**: #7
- **Topic**: Vector Algebra (Component-wise Operations, Dot Product, Norm)
- **Category**: Machine Learning Math / Linear Algebra
- **Difficulty Level**: Beginner
- **Problem Curator**: Phanie

### Prerequisites
- Vector component notation
- Scalar multiplication
- Dot product formula
- Euclidean norm

### Problem Statement

Suppose u = 6i − 2j + 4k and v = 3i + 7j − k

Answer the following questions: (a) to (d)

**(a) Vector Addition**

Compute u + v by adding corresponding components.

**(b) Linear Combination of Vectors**

Compute 4u − 3v

Find: scale each vector, then add the results componentwise.

**(c) Dot Product**

Compute the dot product u · v

Multiply corresponding components and add.

**(d) Magnitude (Norm) of a Vector**

Compute ||u||

Take the square root of the sum of the squares of its components.

### Motivation and Context

**Why This Matters:**

These vector skills are foundational for ML:

**Relevance to ML/DL/AI:**
- **Vector addition** → combining feature vectors
- **Scalar-vector multiplication** → scaling gradients
- **Dot product** → similarity in embeddings, attention weights
- **Norm** → distances in clustering, regularization, normalization

**Theoretical Significance:**

These operations are the backbone of all linear models and neural-network computations.

### Hints and Guidance

**Consider:**

- Add and subtract components of i, j, k separately for u + v

- For 4u − 3v, compute each piece:
  ```
  4u = (24, −8, 16)
  −3v = (−9, −21, 3)
  ```

- **Dot product rule**: u · v = u₁v₁ + u₂v₂ + u₃v₃

- **Norm rule**: ||u|| = √(u₁² + u₂² + u₃²)

### Discussion Space

**Questions:**
- How do the i, j, k unit vectors make component operations more intuitive?
- What does the sign of u · v tell you about the angle between the vectors?
- Why is the norm always non-negative?

**Initial Observations:**
- Vector operations in ℝ³ using i, j, k notation
- Component-wise arithmetic is fundamental to all higher operations
- The dot product combines both direction and magnitude information
