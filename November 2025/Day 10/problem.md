# Daily Math Problem - DAY 10

### Problem Metadata
- **Date**: 2025-11-20
- **Problem Number**: #10
- **Topic**: Complex Vectors in ℂ³ (Addition, Scalar Multiplication)
- **Category**: Machine Learning Math / Linear Algebra
- **Difficulty Level**: Beginner → Intermediate
- **Problem Curator**: Phanie

### Prerequisites
- Complex numbers in form a + bi
- Operations in ℂ: addition, multiplication
- Vector arithmetic in ℂⁿ
- Scalar-vector multiplication

### Problem Statement

Consider the vectors in ℂ³:

```
u = [1 + 4i, −2 + i, 5 − i]
v = [3 − i, 6 + 2i, −1]
```

**(a) Vector Addition**

Compute u + v

Add corresponding complex components and simplify.

**(b) Scalar-Vector Multiplication**

Let the complex scalar be α = 2 − 3i

Compute the product:

```
αu = (αu₁, αu₂, αu₃)
```

Multiply (2 − 3i) with each component of u and simplify each result.

### Motivation and Context

**Why This Matters:**

Complex vectors appear in ML and signal-processing domains:

**Relevance to ML/DL/AI:**
- **Fourier and wavelet transforms** → audio models, vision preprocessing, spectral features
- **Complex-valued neural networks** → used in MRI reconstruction, radar, quantum-inspired models
- **Hermitian inner products** → underpin unitary matrices, relevant in optimization stability
- **Complex embedding representations** → in certain advanced architectures

**Theoretical Significance:**

Mastering complex vector operations ensures fluency when transitioning into spectral learning and models involving frequency-domain representations.

### Hints and Guidance

**Consider:**

- **For (a)**: Combine real parts and imaginary parts separately
  ```
  (a + bi) + (c + di) = (a + c) + (b + d)i
  ```

- **For (b)**: Use the multiplication rule:
  ```
  (a + bi)(c + di) = (ac − bd) + (ad + bc)i
  ```

- Keep the vector structure aligned: compute and simplify each component fully

### Discussion Space

**Questions:**
- Why do complex vector spaces require conjugation in inner products?
- How does scalar multiplication in ℂ differ from ℝ?
- Why do Fourier-based ML models rely heavily on complex arithmetic?
- What advantages do complex-valued features have in signal models?

**Initial Observations:**
- Complex vectors extend real vectors to capture phase and magnitude
- Component-wise operations follow the same structure as in ℝⁿ
- Complex scalar multiplication involves both rotation and scaling
- The imaginary unit i adds another dimension to each component
