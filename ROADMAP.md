3. **Study Probability Theory alongside or after Multivariable Calculus**
   - Can be learned somewhat independently
   - Connects deeply with all other areas for advanced topics

4. **Integrate knowledge through practical problems**
   - Apply concepts to real ML problems
   - See how topics interconnect in practice
